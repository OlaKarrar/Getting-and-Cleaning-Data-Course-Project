# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
##Introduction:
  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
  
the data for the project can be downloaded from:

This data is a results of experiments that  have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

##Requirements:
Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Raw Files:
The row files that has been used to meet the above requirements are:

* `features.txt` List of all features.
* `activity_labels.txt` Links the class labels with their activity name.
* `train/X_train.txt` Training set.
* `train/y_train.txt` Training labels.
* `test/X_test.txt` Test set.
* `test/y_test.txt` Test labels.
* `train/subject_train.txt` `test/subject_test.txt` Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 

##Final Project Output:
*`run_analysis.R` The R script that have been used to get `TidyData.Rda` from the above raw files.
*`TidyData.Rda` Tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
